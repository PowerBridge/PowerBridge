PowerBridge
============

What is PowerBridge?
--------------------------------
PowerBridge is a build task library that bridges the worlds of MSBuild and PowerShell. PowerBridge's build tasks host the PowerShell runtime and forwards Write-Host, Write-Warning, Write-Verbose and Write-Error messages to MSBuild appropriately, allowing you to call your PowerShell scripts from within your build with deep MSBuild integration.
